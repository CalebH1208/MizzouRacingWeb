      <h3>What We Do...</h3>
      <p>
        We keep the team running. Ensuring deadlines are hit 
        and budgets are balanced. The ability to make it to 
        competition each year necessitates organization, fiscal 
        responsibility, and communication. Nobody wants to maintain 
        the spreadsheets... but someone has to.

            Justin is a fourth-year Computer Science and Electrical Engineering student, 
            and the President of Mizzou Racing. He joined the team in Fall 2022 after he 
            saw a flyer hanging outside of Naka Hall. Justin was the team’s treasurer in 
            2023-24. He designs electrical harnesses and embedded software systems, and 
            considers himself the “resident CAN (theory) expert.” Justin’s goal for the 
            year is to graduate.
