      <h3>What We Do...</h3>
      <p>
        This subsystem encompasses brakes, controls, & ergonomics. We use Wilwood brake 
        calipers with laser cut rotors. Our steering wheel has paddle shifters for sequential 
        pneumatic shifting. Cockpit design is a new goal for this season, specifically making 
        it more adjustable for each driver. We currently have an adjustable pedal chassis with 
        carbon fiber foot cups.

            the team in the fall of 2023. His main goal for this season 
            is to overall improve the car with changes such as a more 
            comfortable steering wheel. Josh is also a member of our 
            welding team, fabricates suspension and powertrain components.
