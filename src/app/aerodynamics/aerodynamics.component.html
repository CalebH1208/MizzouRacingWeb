      <h3>What We Do...</h3>
      <p>
        The subsystem works to design and manufacture aerodynamic components 
        for the racecar. With the help of our sponsors, we can manufacture 
        our aerodynamic package completely in house. The package creates a 
        downforce on the tires and in turn alters the maximum frictional 
        force the car’s tires can generate. Components include front and 
        rear wings, an undertray, nosecone, and sidepods.

            Ryan is a junior mechanical engineering major. Joining the team in 
            Fall 2023 he has dedicated his time to designing, validating, and 
            manufacturing the car's aerodynamic package. Ryan has designed the 
            front wing, rear wing and so much more. In addition he also works 
            with other members to design other parts of our aerodynamics package. 
            Ryan is also one of our two vehicle dynamics leads.
